# Movie_Booking_Website
I build this the other day at a Java workshop I attended at the DevNexus convention. You can view, add, and delete movies from the site. it also shows sales and has a chat room.

This is not my original code.  It is from a workshop teaching me about Maven and Rest, but it is also cool and allowed by the host, so here it is.

The technologies used to build this were JavaEE, Maven, and Rest.  There is at this point an issue with the points link, in that it doesn't calculate points.
